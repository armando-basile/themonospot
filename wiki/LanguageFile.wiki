= Use language files =

From release 0.6.4 Themonospot support language files. Are text files containing rows of follow type:
 KEY=_Value_
their names are equal to _<language_name>_.*ls* and you can find them:
 * *On Linux*: in the folder /usr/lib/themonospot/languages
 * *On Windows*: in the folder _<application_path>\languages_
Themonospot select automatically language file to use by user language configured. If there isn't a language file named as user language configured, select English.ls language file as default.

= Modify language file =
To modify an existent language file you need only write/update access at _*languages*_ folder and can do it with a text editor (gedit, kwrite, kate, notepad, wordpad, etc.).

= Add new language file =
To add a language file for your user language configured you need:
 # write/update access at _*languages*_ folder
 # know your user language exact name (_English_ is different from _english_) on your system

To detect fastly your user language name you can lunch Themonospot from a shell in _DEBUG MODE_:
{{{
mono --debug <application_path>/themonospot.exe
}}}
so you can read the shell message that report this information:
{{{
Gtk language = English; Available language = English
}}}

If you have a _<Gtk language>.ls_ file in your Themonospot _languages_ folder, the application already select it as language file.

Otherwise you can create a new text file with name _<Gtk language>.ls_ in your Themonospot _languages_ folder.
After copy and paste _KEYS NAME_ in this file from other language file and complete it with _KEYS VALUE_ in your language.
